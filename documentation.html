            <h3>Summary</h3>
            <p>This website was designed and created to inform and showcase the James Bond franchise, the website<br/>
                showcases many fan favourite moments and items; such as the stunts gadgets that were created by Q and the exquisite cars.<br/>
                Applications that were used during the creation of this website was mainly Webstorm and Sublime text editors;<br/>
                During the development of the website I changed from using Sublime to Webstorm  as it provided a spellchecker.<br/>
                The default photo viewer on MacOS was also used for the resizing and orientation of certain images. An additional feature which was added to the website<br/>
                was the user having the option to change the content box background colors to night or day, an option of their choice.<br/>
                Due to the Night and Day theme using a cookie to store the user settings I also added cookie consent to the website <br/>
                Google analytics were also added to the website.</p>

            <h3>Accessibility</h3>
            Appropriate ALT tags were added to ensure that if elements failed to load or were being read by a screen reader the user would/should know<br/>
            what specific elements were.
            The website is also navigational without using the mouse as the user is able to browse using the tab and enter<br/>
            keys, in case any users have disabilities not allowing them to use a mouse. A screen reader was also used on all pages <br/>
            to ensure that it worked correctly for any users who prefer or need to use a screen reader. Also the website was <br/>
            accessed on a mobile device to ensure that users who do not have access to computer would still be able to have an enjoyable experience<br/>
            when viewing the website. Clear navigation has also been added to the website to ensure that it is easy to navigate with links<br/>
            changing color once the user has accessed them. Finally the website was all validated using w3schools validator and all pages were <br/>
            viewed using the chrome extension "WCAG Luminosity Contrast Ratio Analyzer" which allowed me to view the page the same as people <br/>
            with certain viewing defects they may have, and validator the contrast of colors and view in black and white and inverted color schemes <br/>

            <h3>Security</h3>
            <p>In regards to security, I have decided that users will not be able to upload any files, avatar icons or images<br/>
                as this would be a huge security risk.
                No CMS tools were used in the creation of the website; CMS designed websites are targeted by hackers and spammers if they are not kept updated,<br/>
                hackers could gain access to the website and secure information. During the development of the website a HTTPS connection was also considered(SSL certificate)<br/>
                but due to a server space being allocated to us this was not possible. Another consideration was that if any errors were caught that they would<br/>
                not be displayed to the end user as this could lead to a security breach if information was provided. Also in the future I plan to add a user<br/>
                log in where passwords would be a minimum of 8 characters including an uppercase, lowercase and special character within the password.<br/>
                Firewalls and additional security  such as DDOS prevention were also considered being added on the server level.<br/>
                Credentials for the server would also require a much stronger password, biometric access could also be implemented for physical and virtual access<br/>

            <h3>Future Enhancements</h3>
            <p> In future I would like to improve upon the night and day feature where all elements on the webpage change such as the navigation menu,<br/>
                Additional color schemes would also be implemented making it, more accessible to users that may be color blind with specific colors<br/>
                I would also like to improve on making the website more mobile friendly as just now it scales and is usable on mobiles, but would like<br/>
                to have a burger menu display on mobile devices for easier navigation. Additionally I would like to add more security to the website so that<br/>
                users and myself know they are secure when browsing and entering sensitive information, such as a HTTPS secure connection.<br/>
                Finally from a marketing standpoint I would like to add links to social media making content easier to share and allowing the access of logging
                in using these sites.<br/>
