            <h3>The 1935 Bentley Mark IV Drophead 3.5 Litre</h3>
            <p>The first car that 'James Bond' drove  was a Sunbeam Alpine Series II 1962. Not his most expensive car,
                but definitely worth mentioning. The 1935 Bentley Mark IV appeared in the second James Bond movie -
                From Russia With Love(1963). Due to the Ian Fleming novels,
                James Bond drives a Bentley 4.5 litre, therefor, it was important for the producers to
                include a Bentley in the film. In 'From Russia With Love', James is seen picnicking with Sylvia Trench alongside the Bentley.
                He pulls the convertible top up from the car and he and Sylvia have some Bond-style alone time.

            <h3>Aston Martin DB10 (2015)</h3>
            <p>In November 2015, Daniel Craig stars in the 24th James Bond film.  Spectre (2015) was his fourth
                performance as the spy. In the Bond movie before this, Skyfall (2012), James was seen driving the classic
                Aston Martin DB5. Since Skyfall (2012), Bond has not been on the
                movie screens in 3 years. This offers Aston Martin the perfect opportunity to have 007 drive the amazing new
                2015 DB10. It has a whole new look!, it is almost unrecognisable. The car is still a 2 door coupe .
                The DB10 was unveiled in December 2014 as the official James Bond car.
                This year marks the 50 year anniversary of the partnership between Aston Martin and the James Bond Franchise.
                This is James Bond’s 6th Aston Martin.

            <h3>The 1985 Aston Martin V8 Vantage Volante </h3>
            <p>For unknown reasons producers did not want to debut the 1985 V8 Vantage Volante the same year A View to Kill (1985)
                came out, however it did make it's appearance in The Living Daylights (1987). But, it’s never too late to put
                an Aston Martin into the movie.  James Bond also got an update in this movie due to Timothy Dalton who ended up playing the James Bond
                the character. Aston Martin came back in this film after an 18 year break. The look of this car is almost the exact
                same as the Aston Martin DBS that appeared in Her Majesty’s Secret Service (1969).

            <h3>BMW Z8 (1999)</h3>
            <p>After Timothy Dalton’s acting as James Bond it flopped with the audiences, the franchise
                took a production break for roughly 5 years.  They restarted the franchise with a fresh look and a
                charming new Bond (Pierce Brosnan).
                That also brought on a vehicle update!  BMW decided to take over and sponsor the movies!
                In The World is not Enough (1999), James Bond drove a BMW Z8.
                . It’s sleek, classic, and of course was equipped with surface-to-air missile launchers. BMW’s decision
                to put James Bond in their car was extremely good for business as every movie that featured their cars caused
                a huge spike in sales.

            <h3>Ford Fairlane (1957)</h3>
            <p>Bond is known for always being picture perfect and having the car to match his attire.
                In Die Another Day(2002), 007 ends up in Havana, Cuba and features the Ford Fairlane which although is not the fastest Bond
                car and is not equipped with gadgets, it was perfect for the scene. The car was only in the movie briefly and not equipped with any gadgets
                but created a iconic bond moment.
